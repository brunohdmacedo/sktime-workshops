sktime workshops & tutorials
============================

This is a repository for tutorials for `sktime <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/>`_, a `scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`__
compatible Python toolbox for machine learning with time series.

For deep learning methods, we have a separate extension package:
`sktime-dl <https://github.com/sktime/sktime-dl>`__.


How to get started
------------------

You have two options to run the tutorials:

* `Launch <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sktime/sktime-workshops/master>`_ an interactive Jupyter notebook on Binder to run tutorials in the cloud

* `Install sktime <https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/installation.html>`_ and download repository to run tutorials locally
